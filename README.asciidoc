= .vim

This is my .vim directory with all of its plugins etc. Feel free to clone it and
use it for your vim editor.

== Configuration
The plugins that I use I have added to this repo via submodules. Clone the repo,
load the submodules and then run the configure.sh script. Since I use the
pathogen plugin, the script adds a symbolic link in the autoload directory. The
script also sets a link in your home directory to the .vimrc in this repo. Thus
be careful. Backup your existing .vimrc and .vim directory before using my
setup.
